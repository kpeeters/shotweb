Shotweb: web server for shotwell photo databases

**WARNING** **This is not yet feature-complete**

Shotweb is a simple, modern and compact C++ server for Linux to share
Shotwell [https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Shotwell] photo albums via the
web. I have a large collection of photos and videos which I do not
want to store in a cloud service, but still want to share with friends
and family. The master copy lives on my laptop and is
categorised/labelled with Shotwell. I thus simply wanted to share
individual Shotwell events with other people. Because I could not find
anything suitable (most photo sharing server software, such as Piwigo
or Nextcloud, is *far* to complex while still not serving my basic
needs), I decided to write one myself.

Features:

* Serve directly from the shotwell database and photo folders.
* Photos as well as videos.
* Multiple user accounts.
* Each user can be given access to individual events.
* Events can be shared by sending a link with a token, does not
  require guest to register an account.
* Generates thumbnails for photos and videos on the fly.
* Thumbnail caching.
* Clean compact C++ with handcoded HTML/CSS/JS.

In the pipeline:

* Photo pre-loading for quick browsing.
* Download single photos or entire events as zip files.


There are a few related projects, mostly unmaintained, which inspired
Shotweb::

Building
--------

These are instructions for Debian/Ubuntu, adjust the build
prerequisites appropriately for other distros. First install the
prerequisites with::

    sudo apt install cmake g++ libopencv-dev libboost-all-dev \
                     libsqlite3-dev libscrypt-dev ffmpegthumbnailer 
    
You need a fairly decent C++ compiler, so on e.g. Ubuntu 18.04 you
will need to install clang and then do e.g.::

    export CXX=/usr/bin/clang++-7
    export CC=/usr/bin/clang-7    
    
With gcc 7.4.0 (and possibly others) you will get errors about
`std::experimental::optional<T>`.

Make sure you checkout the git submodules:

    cd shotweb
    git submodule update --init --recursive

Then build and install with::

    cd shotweb
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install



Running
-------

Run the shotweb server with::

    shotweb [path-to-config-file]

The configuration file is a JSON file with the following content::

    {
        "photo.db":        "/path/to/photo.db",
        "auth.db":         "/path/to/auth.db",
        "html_css_js_dir": "/usr/local/share/shotweb/",
        "thumb_cache_dir": "/path/to/thumbnails/",
        "old_root":        "",
        "new_root":        "",
        "port":            8123,
        "title":           "title of your gallery"
    }

The meaning of the parameters is::

  * photo.db:   
        
       The full path to the 'photo.db' database, as generated by
       Shotwell. Use a copy if you can.
       
  * auth.db:
  
       The full path of the authentication database file
       'auth.db'. Can be empty on start, in which case the first
       access to shotweb will ask for a new admin name and password.
       
  * html_css_js_dir:
  
       The directory in which the HTML/CSS/JS files are stored. This
       is typically '/usr/local/share/shotweb/' or similar.

  * thumb_cache_dir:
  
       A path where shotweb will cache thumbnail images. You can
       re-use the thumbnails produced by shotwell if you want, in
       which case you should set this to something like
       
         `${HOME}/.cache/shotwell/thumbs/thumbs360/`

  * old_root:
  * new_root:
  
       If the location of the pictures on the shotweb server is *not*
       the same as the location of the pictures on your shotwell
       installation, shotweb needs to rewrite the paths in `photo.db`
       in order to find the picture files. The `old_root` and
       `new_root` settings are respectively the root of the picture
       storage on your shotwell setup, and the root of the picture
       storage on your shotweb server. You could have e.g::
       
           "old_root":   "/home/user/Pictures/",
           "new_root":   "/var/shotweb/pictures/"
           
  * port:
  
       The IP port on which to run the server. If you want to run it
       over https, the best idea is to run it behind an apache or
       nginx web server and let that one proxy the connection to
       shotweb. 
    
Once the server is running, you can access the site and setup your
administrator password (do this immediately!).

    
    
Video re-encoding
-----------------

Shotweb will automatically convert all videos so they adapt to the
available bandwidth of the viewer, using HLS; see

  [https://www.exoscale.com/syslog/self-hosted-videos/]

for more info. This uses the `video2hls` script taken from

  [https://github.com/vincentbernat/video2hls]
  
Video conversion is triggered by the shotweb server automatically, 
and it keeps a queue of videos to convert.
  
**WARNING:** This is a new feature; if you click on a video the
conversion will start in the background, but you will need to reload
the event page (after the conversion has completed) to be able to view
the video.
